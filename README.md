# Traffic Flow Data Analysis

This project utilizes traffic flow data to predict future traffic patterns using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

## Data Source

The data was sourced from the Highways England Traffic Flow Data system, which can be accessed [here](https://tris.highwaysengland.co.uk/detail/trafficflowdata). The data was then squared for the purpose of this analysis.

## Usage

Run `main.py` with Python to execute the traffic flow prediction model.
